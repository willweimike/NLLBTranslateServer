## Translate Locally, Privately
Google Translate API are convenient to use, but people may concern about "privacy" since data must be send to the remote to do the translation work

## Setup
Place the binary alongside with your model folder, **"The File and Folder Name"** must be the same as the picture

In terminal
1. type `sudo chmod 777 path/to/NTS_darwin` to allow the executable to run and fetch nllb files
2. type `xattr -cr path/to/NTS_darwin` to eliminate warning from Apple Signature
3. type `./NTS_darwin` to start server

Everything is now ready
