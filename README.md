# NLLBTranslateServer - Translate Locally

## Locally, Privately
Yandax Translate API / Google Translate API are all convenient to use, but people are concerned about "Privacy" since user data must be send to the remote to do the translation work

## Easy to set up
Please place the binary alongside with your model folder, **"The File and Folder Name"** must be the same as the picture 

In terminal, type `sudo chmod u+x NTS_darwin` to allow the executable to run, and then type `./NTS_darwin`. 

Everything is now ready ðŸŒŸ
